        <p class="text-sm muted-text">
            I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with experience as a 
            <strong>Software Engineering Intern</strong> at companies including Kratos Inno Tech, UNH Interoperability Lab, and Kubotek USA. 
            Iâ€™ve worked across <strong>frontend development, software testing, and technical documentation</strong>, contributing to 
            products used by leading companies such as Intel, Samsung, and Kioxia. 
            My projects include developing a <strong>mobile health app</strong> that processes signals from a wearable sensor to 
            calculate blood pressure, and building <strong>full-stack applications</strong> with technologies like React, TypeScript, Next.js, Flask, and PostgreSQL. 
            I enjoy solving technical challenges, creating intuitive solutions, and exploring new technologies that push my skills further.
